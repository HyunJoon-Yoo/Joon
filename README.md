# Physical computing

## What is physical computing?
<p> 
Physical computing is the process of understanding, planning, and implementing projects, both large and small. These projects offer you the opportunity to practice and hone your design skills and your ability to turn your designs into reality.
</p>

## Uses of physical computing
  <ul>
    <li> Programming an LED to flash</li>
    <li> Reading environmental data from a sensor</li>
    <li> Controlling robotic objects</li>
    <li> Application</li>
      <ul>
       <li> creative art</li>
        <li>Museums</li>
        <li>Ubiquitous</li>
        <li>Embedded computing</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

## What is Arduino?
<p>Arduino designs, manufactures, and supports electronic devices and software, allowing people around the world to easily access advanced technologies that interact with the physical world. Our products are straightforward, simple, and powerful, ready to satisfy users’ needs from students to makers and all the way to professional developers.</p>





# JavaScript
<p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
</p>

### Examples of web page with JavaScript
<ul>
 <li>(Show or hide) Button with linked with more information</li>
 <li>Changing colour of boutton when the mouse hovers over it</li>
 <li>Zoom in or out an image</li>
 <li>Time set and displaying clock on a website</li>
 <li>Playing audio and video</li>
</ul>

# Why JavaScript?
<p> JavaScript is the most used programming language in developer. And which strentch makes that many programme developers prefer to used JavaScript?</p>
<h3> 1. The big community and ecosystem</h3>
<p>JavaScript is the most popular progamme language and many developer participate trying to make the language our own and they share this new language to other and also give some guide to flesher how to use JavaScript. This allow for more people to join, since the different frameworks and modules end up doing the same thing, just in a different ways.</p>

<h3> 2. Self evolving</h3>
<p> A part from huge community, the language itself is constantly evolving. Although JavaScript itself (the term) is owned by Oracle,the language is meant to follow the specifications of ECMAScript. And these specifications are in fact, controlled indirectly by the community itself, and regulated and organized by the TC39 committee. They review all the different proposals to evolve the language, and work with them until they’re mature enough. Once they are, then it’s up to runtime owners to implement those updates if they want to stay compliant</p>
