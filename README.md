# JavaScript
<p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
